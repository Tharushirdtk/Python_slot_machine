#ðŸŽ° Slot Machine Game (Python CLI)

This is a simple command-line based Slot Machine game built with Python. The game allows users to deposit money, place bets on one or more lines, and spin the slot machine to win based on matching symbols. Itâ€™s a great beginner-level project to understand functions, loops, conditionals, and user input in Python.

   git clone https://Tharushirdtk/Python_slot_machine.git/slot-machine-game.git
   cd slot-machine-game

## ðŸ§©Run the game:
  python slot_machine.py

##Follow the on-screen instructions:

    Deposit money to your balance

    Choose how many lines you want to bet on (1 to 3)

    Place your bet (must be between $1 and $100)

  ##ðŸ§  Game Logic
  The slot machine consists of a 3x3 grid (3 rows, 3 columns).

Symbols (A, B, C, D) are randomly placed in the grid.

Payouts depend on the symbol and number of lines bet:

    A: 5x your bet

    B: 4x your bet

    C: 3x your bet

    D: 2x your bet

A line wins if all symbols in that line are the same.
